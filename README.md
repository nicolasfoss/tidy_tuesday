👋 **Hello, and welcome!** This repository is dedicated to my entries for the #TidyTuesday project, where I explore and visualize data.

## About #TidyTuesday 📅

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project that provides datasets for the data science community to practice and improve their data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills. Each week offers a new challenge, perfect for honing your skills and exploring interesting datasets!

## Repository Structure 🗂️

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different week's dataset, and includes:

- 📁 **Scripts**: R and Julia scripts used for data analysis and visualization will be contained in Jupyter notebooks.
- 🖼️ **Visualizations**: I will typically share a capstone visualization for the project that will show up on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/dr-nicolas-foss-ms-15b760253).
